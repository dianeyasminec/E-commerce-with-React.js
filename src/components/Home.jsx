      The latest trend is the market has been to go natural. 
      Natural products are quite a rage and taking the market by storm,
       handmade soaps being one of them. So what is so different about 
       handmade soaps from the normal ones available in the market?
       <div className='py-3'><strong>1. Formulation</strong></div>
       Handmade soaps, as the name suggests, are made by hand. This ropes
        out the procedure of being manufactured by a big machine set up in 
        a factory. When the ingredients of the soap are mixed, natural
         glycerin is extracted from the same. The manufacturers of 
         commercial soaps remove this glycerin and give it to cosmetic 
         companies to earn a higher profit. On the other hand, handmade soaps
          retain the glycerin which prevents the skin from drying out. You can 
          try the√Ç Sand For Soapaholics Body Soap Butter Up for buttery soft skin.
          <div className='py-3'> <strong>2. No Additives</strong></div>
          Handmade soaps do not contain any chemical additives like SLS, SLES,
           parabens, etc. Commercial soaps are laden with these ingredients to
            make them lather more. Due to the addition of so many chemicals, 
            there is practically no difference between soaps and detergents 
            available in the market. This also brings down the costs of
             producing a normal soap, which is why you will always find a 
             handmade soap expensive as compared to a commercial one
             <div className='py-3'> <strong>3. Natural Ingredients</strong></div>
             A handmade soap may not lather as much as a commercial one, and
              this is because of no chemicals. These soaps contain the natural
               goodness of ingredients like apple, berries, clay, rose, lavender, 
               etc. Handmade soaps retain the properties of these natural ingredients
                which helps you to get better skin. For e.g, you can use soaps that
                 contain butter to get smooth skin. Soaps with coffee, vanilla can be 
                 used for their skin lightening properties.
